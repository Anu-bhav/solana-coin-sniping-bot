# --- Token Filtering Pipeline --- (Run in order)
filtering:
  enabled: true

  # 1. Contract & Liquidity Checks
  contract_liquidity:
    enabled: true
    min_initial_sol_liquidity: 0.1 # Min SOL paired at creation (Devnet: low, Mainnet: higher)
    max_initial_sol_liquidity: 10.0 # Max SOL paired at creation (Avoid whales? Devnet: low)
    check_burn_status: false # Check if LP tokens are burned (Needs reliable method/API)
    require_renounced_mint_authority: false # Check if token mint authority is revoked
    require_renounced_freeze_authority: false # Check if token freeze authority is revoked
    check_lp_locks: false # Check if LP tokens are locked (Needs reliable API, e.g., Streamflow, RugCheck)
    min_lp_lock_duration_days: 90 # Minimum lock duration if check_lp_locks is true

  # 2. Metadata & Distribution Checks
  metadata_distribution:
    enabled: false # Often needs APIs / may slow down detection significantly
    check_socials: false # Requires web scraping or API (e.g., Helius)
    require_website: false
    require_twitter: false
    require_telegram: false
    # Holder analysis (Needs reliable API: Helius DAS/Geyser, Birdeye)
    enable_holder_analysis: false
    min_holder_count: 10 # Minimum number of unique holders
    max_creator_holding_pct: 90.0 # Max % the creator can hold
    max_top_10_holder_pct: 70.0 # Max % the top 10 wallets hold combined

  # 3. Rug-Pull / Honeypot Checks
  rug_pull_honeypot:
    enabled: true
    # Basic checks (run locally)
    check_pool_existence: true # Verify the detected pool address actually exists
    check_trade_direction: true # Check if SOL -> Token swap seems possible (basic simulation or pool state)
    # External API Checks (Requires API Keys configured in .env)
    use_external_honeypot_check_api: "none" # Options: none, goplus, defi, both
    fail_if_goplus_error: false # Stop processing token if GoPlus API call fails?
    fail_if_defi_error: false # Stop processing token if De.Fi API call fails?

  # Add more filter stages here later if needed (e.g., velocity, volume)

# --- Transaction Execution Settings ---
execution:
  enabled: true # Set to false to only detect and filter
  provider: SNIPEROO_API # Options: SELF_BUILT, SNIPEROO_API, JITO_BUNDLER
  buy_amount_sol: 0.005 # Amount of SOL to spend per buy (EXTREMELY SMALL FOR DEVNET)
  slippage_percent: 30.0 # Slippage tolerance percentage (e.g., 30.0 for 30%)

  # --- Settings for provider: SELF_BUILT ---
  compute_unit_limit: 1_400_000 # Solana Compute Budget Unit Limit
  compute_unit_price_micro_lamports: 10000 # Priority Fee per Compute Unit (adjust based on network)

  # --- Settings for provider: SNIPEROO_API ---
  sniperoo:
    base_url: "https://api.sniperoo.com" # Check correct API endpoint
    # SNIPEROO_API_KEY must be set in .env

  # --- Settings for provider: JITO_BUNDLER ---
  jito:
    # JITO_BLOCK_ENGINE_URL and JITO_AUTH_KEYPAIR_PATH must be set in .env
    tip_lamports: 10000 # Lamports to tip Jito validator

  # --- General Transaction Settings ---
  max_tx_retries: 2 # Number of times to retry sending a failed transaction
  tx_confirmation_timeout_seconds: 90 # How long to wait for transaction confirmation
  use_transaction_simulation: false # Use simulateTransaction RPC before sending (increases latency but can catch errors)

# --- Position Monitoring & Auto-Sell Settings ---
monitoring:
  enabled: true # Set to false to only buy, not monitor/sell
  # Note: Auto-Sell is primarily for SELF_BUILT execution. Check if SNIPEROO/JITO handle sells.
  enable_auto_sell: true
  poll_interval_seconds: 15 # How often to check price and P/L of open positions

  # --- Basic Take Profit / Stop Loss ---
  take_profit_pct: 100.0 # Sell when price increases by this % (e.g., 100.0 for 2x)
  stop_loss_pct: 50.0 # Sell when price decreases by this % relative to buy price

  # --- Advanced Selling Strategies (Optional) ---
  # Trailing Stop Loss
  enable_trailing_stop_loss: false
  trailing_stop_loss_trigger_pct: 50.0 # Activate TSL when gain reaches this %
  trailing_stop_loss_delta_pct: 15.0 # Sell if price drops this % from highest point after trigger

  # Multi-Level Take Profit (Sell portions at different targets)
  enable_multi_level_take_profit: false
  # Example: Sell 50% at 100% gain, sell remaining 50% at 200% gain
  take_profit_levels: # List of dictionaries: {pct: gain_target, amount_pct: position_size_to_sell}
    - { pct: 100.0, amount_pct: 50.0 }

  # --- Time Stop ---
  enable_time_stop: false # Sell position after a certain time regardless of P/L
