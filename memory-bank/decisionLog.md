# Decision Log

This file records significant architectural or technical decisions made during the project.

---

*   **[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - Decision:** Proceed to Phase 2 (Detection & Filtering Services) after successful completion of Phase 1.
    *   **Context:** Phase 1 (Core Clients & Database) objectives met, including implementation and basic unit testing of `DatabaseManager`, `SolanaClient`, and `HttpClient`. The foundational components are stable enough to build upon.
    *   **Options Considered:**
        *   Proceed to Phase 2 as planned.
        *   Perform further refactoring or more extensive testing on Phase 1 components before proceeding.
        *   Re-evaluate Phase 2 scope based on Phase 1 findings.
    *   **Rationale:** Core components are functional and tested to a baseline level. Blocking further progress on extended Phase 1 work is less valuable than starting the core detection logic in Phase 2. Issues found later can be addressed iteratively.
    *   **Implications:** Development shifts focus to `DetectionService` and related filtering logic. Potential need to revisit Phase 1 components if integration reveals unforeseen issues or requirements.
